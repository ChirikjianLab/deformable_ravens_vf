"""
The main training script, and testing (if using a non-custom task).

A note about random seeds: the seed we set before drawing the episode's
starting state will determine the initial configuration of objects, for both
standard ravens and any custom envs (so far). Currently, if we ask to set 100
demos, the code will run through seeds 0 through 99. Then, for _test_ demos,
we offset by 10**max_order, so that with 100 demos (max_order=2) we'd start
with 10**2=100 and proceed from there. This way, if doing 20 test episodes,
then ALL snapshots are evaluated on seeds {100, 101, ..., 119}. If we change
max_order=3, which we should for an actual paper, then this simply means the
training is done on {0, 1, ..., 999} and testing starts at seed 1000.

With the custom deformable tasks, I have a separate load.py script. That one
also had max_order=3 (so when doing 100 demos, I was actually starting at
seed 1000, no big deal). However, I now have max_order=4 to start at 10K,
because (a) we will want to use 1000 demos eventually, and (b) for the
deformable tasks, sometimes the initial state might already be 'done', so I
ignore that data and re-sample the starting state with the next seed. Having
load.py start at seed 10K will give us a 'buffer zone' of seeds to protect
the train and test from overlapping.

With goal-conditioning, IF the goals are drawn by sampling from a similar
same starting state distribution (as in the case with insertion-goal) then
use generate_goals.py and set max_order=5 so that there's virtually no chance
of random seed overlap.

When training on a new machine, we can run this script with "1000 demos" for
deformable tasks. It will generate data (but not necessarily "1000 demos"
because max_order determines the actual amount), but exit before we can do
any training, and then we can use subsequent scripts with {1, 10, 100} demos
for actual training.

def rollout(agent, env, tasks, args):
    """Standard gym environment rollout. A few clarifications:

    (1) Originally, we did not append the LAST observation and info, since it
    wasn't needed. However I need the last `info` because I record stuff for
    custom envs (e.g., coverage). Don't make it conditioned on 'done' because
    we need it even if done=False, in which case termination is wrt max steps.

    (2) We do a slight hack to save the last observation and last info, which
    we need for goal-conditioning Transporters, and also inspection of data
    to check what the final images look like after the last action.

    (3) Unlike standard gym, the `obs = env.reset(task)` line returns obs={}, an
    EMPTY dict (hence len(obs)==0). Therefore, at t=0, the `episode` list is empty.

    (4) An 'action' normally has these keys: ['camera_config', 'primitive', 'params']
    However, there's a distinction between the ORACLE policies and LEARNED policies.

    (4a) For the ORACLE at t=0, act['primitive'] = None and there is no 'params' key.
    This means that the `env.step(act)` line will NOT actually take the action!
    However, that line WILL return an image observation. So, at t=0, we (a) take no
    action, (b) do not add to `episode` list, (c) but get image observation + info,
    which we can use for the NEXT time step. Thus t=1 is when the first action takes
    place, so for insertion, since it's just one action, we exit the loop when t=1,
    and `len(episode) = 1`. The same applies for learned Transporter policies.

    (4b) For the learned gt_state policies, at t=0, there WILL be a 'params' key, and
    act['primitive'] is not None, hence at t=0 the first action actually takes place.
    This won't affect data collection, as we don't use gt_state for data collection,
    hence all the `episode` stuff gets ignored. However, it will be a bit confusing
    because with insertion (for example) episodes can succeed in one action, but the
    code says they are 'length 0.'

    The reason for (4a) & (4b) can be seen in how these agents implement their `act`
    function. The oracle and Transporter-based policies will return 'empty' actions
    if obs={}, because they rely on images. (Well, some tasks mean the oracle doesn't
    neeed images, but for consistency, the oracle follows the same interface.)

    Anyway, keep this in mind. Actually, the practical effect might be that any
    gt_state policies should run for task.max_steps MINUS one, right? The easiest
    way might be to make the rollout start at t=0 for these agents.

    Returns:
        total_reward: scalar reward signal from the episode, usually 1.0 for
            demonstrators of standard ravens tasks.
        episode: a list of (obs,act,info) tuples used to add to the dataset,
            which formats it for sampling later in training.
        t: time steps (i.e., actions takens) for this episode. If t=0 then
            something bad happened and we shouldn't count this episode.
        last_obs_info: tuple of the (obs,info) at the final time step, the
            one that doesn't have an action.

    Somewhat misleading name. This method is used to determine if we should
    (a) be running training AFTER environment data collection, and (b)

    the --disp option, which is needed to see cloth, will not let us run
    multiple Environment calls. This also applies to (b), but for (b) there's
    an extra aspect: most of these new environments have reward functions
    that are not easily interpretable, or they have extra stuff in `info`
    that would be better for us to use. In that case we should be using
    `load.py` to roll out these policies.

    Actually, even for stuff like cable-shape, where the reward really tells
    us all we need to know, it would be nice to understand failure cases
    based on the type of the target. So for now let's set it to record
